Energy System – Java Simulation
This project simulates an energy system with a graphical user interface, developed in Java. Users can add energy producers (such as hydroelectric plants) to a grid parcel and observe how energy is stored in a battery.

Technologies
- Java
- AWT/Swing for the graphical user interface
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with abstract classes and polymorphism

How to Run?
- Open the project in Apache NetBeans or any Java-compatible IDE.
- Run the EnergetskiSistem.java file as the main class.
A grid will appear where you can add energy producers using the GUI.

Project Structure
Baterija.java – energy storage class with capacity management
Proizvodjac.java – abstract class representing energy producers
Hidroelektrana.java – concrete class for hydroelectric power plants
EnergetskiSistem.java – main class containing GUI logic
Plac.java, Parcela.java, etc. – classes representing grid and land elements
